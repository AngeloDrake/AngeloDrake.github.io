                <p>I am a Full-Stack Web Developer located in Charlotte, NC with over 6 years of Systems Engineering
                    experience. In 2018 the decision to enroll in the UNC
                    Charlotte Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp has been one of the most rewarding yet challenging experiences
                    to date, allowing me to pursue software development quicker. I stay up to date on new technolgies
                    by spending too much time on Reddit, Youtube, and Udemy. When I am not working on personal
                    projects attempting to become a software guru, I am climbing a mountian somewhere (New Zealand is
                    amazing!), traveling with my amazing wife, or playing with our dog Jace.</p>
                <br>
                <p>If you feel I can help you or be a good addition to your team/project, feel free to
                    reach out to me!</p>
